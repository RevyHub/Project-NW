Hidden Control

Overview

NullWarden[0.1] is a modular framework under active development. It is intended as a professional-grade toolkit for authorized operational workflows and analysis. The project is presented with minimal surface detail; implementation and capabilities are documented in internal modules and controlled release notes.

Repository: core framework + plugin scaffold

Target distributions: portable (USB) builds and standalone executables

Key addition: Network Forensics module included

Scope (kept intentionally concise)

NullWarden[0.1] aggregates a set of capabilities useful to authorized operators and analysts. The project intentionally remains ambiguous at the top level; modules clarify specific functionality.

Usage intent

NullWarden[0.1] is designed for lawful, authorized security research, defensive verification, incident response exercises, and education. Operators must ensure they have explicit authorization for any target or environment on which NullWarden is executed.

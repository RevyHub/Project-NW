**Hidden Control**

## Overview
NullWarden is a modular framework under active development. It is intended as a professional-grade toolkit for authorized operational workflows and analysis. The project is presented with minimal surface detail; implementation and capabilities are documented in internal modules and controlled release notes.

---

## Status
- Development phase: **Early / Active**
- Repository: core framework + plugin scaffold
- Target distributions: portable (USB) builds and standalone executables

---

## Scope (kept intentionally concise)
NullWarden will aggregate a set of capabilities useful to authorized operators and analysts. The project intentionally remains ambiguous at the top level; modules will clarify specific functionality.

**Planned / in-progress modules**
- Malware toolbox (module framework for research & simulation)  
- Network mapping & forensics  
- State-of-the-art OSINT tooling  
- Malware removal & remediation utilities

---

## Architecture (high level)
- Single core binary with a plugin manager  
- Sandboxed plugin runtime for module isolation  
- Structured outputs (signed logs, JSON/YAML reports)  
- Compact CLI with alias support for operational use

---

## Usage intent
NullWarden is designed for lawful, authorized security research, defensive verification, incident response exercises, and education. Operators must ensure they have explicit authorization for any target or environment on which NullWarden is executed.
